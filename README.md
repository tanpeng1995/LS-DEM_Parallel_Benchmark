# LS-DEM
This code is derived from Caltech's computational Geomechanics group, led by Prof. Jose Andrade and written by Dr. Reid Kawamoto. To respect their knowledge, 
This version is by Peng Tan during his PhD study and worked together with Prof. Nicholas Sitar. 
The purpose to make this code available to public is that we hope anyone work with similar project can gain hints from it and avoid repeating the same things.
This code is also the part of supplementary material of our paper "Parallel Implementation of LS-DEM with Hybrid MPI+OpenMP", where we proposed a bunch of implementation details to make the code run faster and efficiently.
